Static and interactive visualizations show data in different ways. A static visualization is like a picture—it
doesn’t move or change, and everyone sees the same thing. It’s good for clear and simple messages, like in
printed reports. An interactive visualization lets you click, zoom, or hover to explore the data yourself.
This is helpful when you want to learn more or look at specific parts of the data. Static visuals are easy 
to make and share, while interactive ones need more work and the right technology. Each type is useful depending
on what you want to show and who will be looking at it.
Dashboards are useful for real-time data exploration because they allow users to see the latest information
in one place and interact with it easily. With features like filters, charts, and live updates, users can
quickly spot trends, track changes, and make faster decisions. Dashboards help simplify complex data and
make it easier to understand without needing to look through raw numbers or multiple reports.
Interactive tools like Plotly and Dash help make data easier to understand and share in professional settings.
Instead of looking at static charts, people can click, zoom, and explore the data themselves. This helps teams
see trends, compare numbers, and find insights quickly. Dash lets you build simple web apps that show live
data updates, which is useful for making faster decisions. Overall, these tools make it easier for everyone—whether
they’re data experts or not—to understand and use the information.
